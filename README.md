## Install


Fork this project, then execute the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/real-time-web-1819.git

cd real-time-web-1819
```
Then, you need a Firebase account with a firestore database.
All necessary credentials will be stored in a file you need to put in `/server`.

Then, in `/server/index.js` edit the following lines to match your firebase settings:
```js
const serviceAccount = require('./FIREBASE_KEY_FILENAME.json')

firebase.initializeApp({
  credential: firebase.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
  databaseURL: 'https://YOUR-FIREBASE-PROJECT-NAME.firebaseio.com'
})

```

Now run `npm run dev` to start a dev server on localhost:3000

## Features
